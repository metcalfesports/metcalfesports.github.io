      <description>This will be the first viewable post of (hopefully) many on this website. The initial purpose of this blog is to store projects for SPMC 350, Sports Analysis and Visualiztion. My hope is that after a while, this domain will serve as a place for me to store projects and writing, whether for a class or not, to be viewed publically and serve as a portfolio. Please Enjoy!</description>
