      <description>The 2019-2020 NBA season was a unique one, with the whole season being put on hold, and then resuming months later in the bubble. This didn’t mean it was any less interesting. The league was flush with stars, both legends like LeBron James, and the emergance of a new generation of superstars, like Luka Dončić.
Giannis Antetokoumnpo, the Greek Freak was crowned as the league’s Most Valuable Player, but was he REALLY the top player in the league last season?</description>
