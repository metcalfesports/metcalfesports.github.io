      <description>The 2019-2020 NBA season was a unique one, with the whole season being put on hold, and then resuming months later in the bubble. This didn’t mean it was any less interesting. The league was flush with stars, both legends like LeBron James, and the emergance of a new generation of superstars, like Luka Dončić.
Giannis Antetokoumnpo, the Greek Freak was crowned as the league’s Most Valuable Player, but was he REALLY the top player in the league last season?</description>

      <description>The Buccaneers winning their championship in 2020 all but put away the debate over who the greatest quarterback of all time is. That’s been settled. I found myself wondering what quarterback season was the greatest ever.
I assembled my list of what I believe to be the top 10 seasons in NFL history. This list was made up of Hall of Famers, Champions, and MVPs. Legends of the sport.</description>
