      <description>This will be the first viewable post of (hopefully) many on this website. The initial purpose of this blog is to store projects for SPMC 350, Sports Analysis and Visualiztion. My hope is that after a while, this domain will serve as a place for me to store projects and writing, whether for a class or not, to be viewed publically and serve as a portfolio.</description>

      <description>This is my blog I am creating to store my sports analytics projects. I will likely expand it to include papers and other works I feel would be good additions to my portfolio. This is a living project, and will be updated regularly, so feel free to check back in from time to time.
Thank you!
